## Build

To build the executable download this repo first, then use `make` to create the executable.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memoryInject/ws-client
cd ws-client
make
```

After running the code above it will create executable at `bin/ws`

#### Optional:
If you want to move the `ws` executable to `~/bin`, run `make move` after running `make`, 
this will make `ws` added to `path`.

To connect to a WebSocket server pass the WebSocket address as first argument.

```bash
‚ùØ ws 'ws://localhost:8000/ws'

>>> JSON Data:
{
    "message": "connected"
}

>>> JSON Data:
{
    "message": "Hello World!",
    "type": "notification"
}
```

To exit the program type `q` and `enter`
```bash
~
‚ùØ ws 'ws://localhost:8000/ws'
Connected: ws://localhost:8000/ws

>>> JSON Data:
{
    "message": "connected"
